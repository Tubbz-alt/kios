## What is KiOS?
A Linux OS created by Buildroot which runs Kerberos.io out-of-the-box. This repository is forked from the [thingOS](https://github.com/ccrisan/thingos) project, and cross-compiles for the Raspberry Pi 1, 2, 3 and 4 (more devices will come).

The purpose of this repository is to deliver a minimal but complete Linux OS, in the form of a **.img**, which can be flashed to an SD card.

### How to install KiOS on your Raspberry Pi?
Please go to our [documentation website](https://doc.kerberos.io/2.0/installation/KiOS), there is explained the complete process to get started with Kerberos.io.

### Documentation

More in-depth documentation can be found [on the wiki of thingOS](https://github.com/ccrisan/thingos/wiki). There is explained all the technical stuff. We only made a couple of adjustments:

- [kerberosio-machinery package](https://github.com/kerberos-io/kios/tree/develop/package/kerberosio-machinery)

- [kerberosio-web package](https://github.com/kerberos-io/kios/tree/develop/package/kerberosio-web)
